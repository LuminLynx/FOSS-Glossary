  - term: "Bus Factor"
    definition: "The number of team members that can be hit by a bus before a project fails"
    explanation: "A metric that measures how many developers need to suddenly disappear before a project can no longer continue. A bus factor of 1 means the project relies on a single person - extremely risky!"
    humor: "Also known as the 'lottery factor' for optimists who prefer their team members winning millions over getting flattened. Some companies have tried improving their bus factor by banning employees from traveling together, which rather misses the point."

  - term: "Rubber Duck Debugging"
    definition: "Explaining your code to an inanimate object to find bugs"
    explanation: "The act of debugging by explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck (or any object). Often, the act of explaining reveals the problem."
    humor: "The rubber duck is the only team member who never judges your code, never asks for a raise, and somehow gives better advice than most Stack Overflow answers. Senior ducks command higher salaries."

  - term: "Dependency Hell"
    definition: "A situation where software dependencies become so tangled, outdated, or incompatible that progress grinds to a halt"
    explanation: "You try to install a package, but it needs a newer version of another package, which conflicts with a third package, which depends on a deprecated library that only works on an older OS you no longer have. Every fix breaks something else."
    humor: "Like a soap opera for code: everyone’s connected, nobody’s happy, and you’re stuck watching the drama unfold while your build fails."
