## 12. Operational Logistics & Risk Management
- **Owners & Roles:**
  - Campaign Lead – overall coordination & reporting.
  - Content Lead – editorial calendar, copy reviews.
  - Community Lead – discussions, events, moderation.
  - Ops Lead – tooling, analytics, security follow-up.
- **Tooling:** Notion (or HackMD) for calendar, Figma/Canva for visual assets, Buffer/Mastodon scheduler, OBS/StreamYard for live events.
- **Security & Maintenance:**
  - During environment setup, four npm vulnerabilities were identified. ✅ Resolved by removing unused packages (`express`, `discord.js`, `@octokit/rest`) and regenerating the lockfile; continue running `npm audit --production` weekly to ensure the dependency set stays clean.
  - Document dependency updates in release notes; avoid campaign content on days with major dependency downtime.
- **Budget Considerations:** Optional $100-200 buffer for boosted newsletter placement or design help.
- **Risk Mitigations:** Define escalation path for inappropriate submissions; maintain CoC-aligned moderation checklist.
